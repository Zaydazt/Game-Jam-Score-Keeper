Valve Master Score Keeper

Author: Zaydazt

Overview

Valve Master Score Keeper is a pressure-based scoring system inspired by real-world air pressure valves, with a fantastical twist: air pressure literally represents momentum. Players are not just earning points — they are operating a machine that builds power the longer and more successfully it is used. Every successful action increases score and raises pressure simultaneously. Combos indicate how quickly pressure is rising, and multipliers show how efficiently pressure and actions convert into points.

The system encourages risk and reward: too much air pressure leads to an overload and explosion. Players must balance momentum, timing, and strategic pressure releases to maximize their score. The pressure gauge is divided into three zones:

Green (0–40 PSI): Safe and stable, steady points (×1), players feel in control.

Yellow (40–75 PSI): Warning state, multipliers active (×1.5), tension builds, but players can react.

Red (75–100 PSI): Critical state, multiplier capped (×2), pressure continues rising toward explosion. Players must decide whether to push for high scores or release pressure to survive.

The system includes a live match log to display players’ actions in real-time, audio feedback for successes, failures, and explosions, and a high score tracker to personalize the experience. Explosions reset combos and multipliers but do not reduce the total score, emphasizing momentum loss over punishment.
